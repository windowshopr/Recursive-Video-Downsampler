# Recursive-Video-Downsampler
A small script I made that recursively looks inside a folder (and all of its subfolders) looking for movie files, then running a PowerShell command using FFMPEG to reduce the filesize of the video, deleting the original. This has been extraordinarily useful in saving cloud storage space with all of the learning material videos I have accumulated over the years.

# Disclaimer
All of my repositories (including this one) are NOT actively maintained. I have disabled issues, so if you decide to download or use any of my projects, you will troubleshoot any issues yourself. You can safely assume that most of my repo's are in a "proof-of-concept" stage; some of them are completed and working, others are just templates that need more work. The repo's I choose to post on GitHub are meant for review, storage and job applications. Thank you.
